<h3>A Diary for a Modern Woman<h3>
</div>

<div class="text-about">

<h4>Pascualina was born from the memories of writing in the vintage 
“Pascualina” diaries and agendas the designer grew up writing her most personal childhood thoughts into. Pascualina has grown up, and the pre-teens who were devoted to the diaries have to. 

The modern take on Pascualina takes the concept of diary writing, online, where anonymity and privacy are two things that the internet makes us reflect about the most. In this site, you can write down anything that comes to your mind at any time, and it will be stored anonymously, only using your IP address to access what you have written before. You can also access everything that has ever been published on the site if you want a taste of voyeurism in the intimate minds of everyone who has ever submitted into Pascualina. 

As we grow up, the need of feeling understood and not alone doesn’t fade away, we crave it still, sometimes even more. Through Pascualina you can vent your thoughts and then read the ones of your anonymous fellow struggling humans out there just trying to feel heard and understood.
